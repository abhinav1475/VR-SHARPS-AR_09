        Welcome to the AI-Driven Crop Disease Management System! 🌱💻

    Our mission is to empower farmers in managing crop health through advanced technology. Upload an image of your crop and relevant environmental data, and our system will analyze them to predict potential diseases and provide actionable insights for treatment.

    ### How It Works
    1. **Upload Data:** Go to the **Disease Management** page and upload an image of your crop along with environmental data.
    2. **Analysis:** Our AI-driven system will process the information using sophisticated algorithms to identify disease symptoms and assess contributing factors.
    3. **Results:** View predictions and receive tailored recommendations for disease management.

    ### Why Choose Us?
    - **Accuracy:** We utilize state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for precise disease detection and insights.
    - **User-Friendly:** A simple and intuitive interface for seamless interaction.
    - **Proactive Management:** Gain early warnings and practical recommendations to optimize crop health and yields.

    ### Get Started
    Click on the **Disease Management** page in the sidebar to upload your data and experience the benefits of our AI-driven system!

    ### About Us
    Learn more about our project, our team, and our goals on the **About** page.

                #### About Dataset
                This dataset is recreated using offline augmentation from the original dataset. The original dataset can be found on this GitHub repo.
                This dataset consists of about 87K RGB images of healthy and diseased crop leaves categorized into 38 different classes. The total dataset is divided into an 80/20 ratio of training and validation set preserving the directory structure.
                A new directory containing 33 test images is created later for prediction purposes.
                #### Content
                1. train (70295 images)
                2. test (33 images)
                3. validation (17572 images)
